# Contribution

Thanks for your interest! 

As your help is highly appreciated, there are only two *hard constraints*:

1. Be friendly and patient in issues, PRs and comments.
2. Create code,commits and assets in english. 

But please consider also the following: 

* Please try to stick to the PR-Template    
* Comment on an Issue if you are working on it. If there is no issue for your idea yet, please feel free to open one.
* If you are stuck at an issue, consider adding the Label Help Wanted and tag a contributor in the comments.
* Either change code or CI/CD parts. If you want to change both, for stability please make two PRs.
* Keep commit messages on the topic and meaningfull - consider using the commit-message-template.
